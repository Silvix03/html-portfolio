<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Helllo everybody. My name is Silvia and i was born in Florence, Italy. I'm 29 years old and after a long time working for a leather factory, now i am studying for being a developer.</p>

<p>My hobbies are reading (a lot), my Kawasaki, practice karate and gym and travelling. I really love travelling and my favourire place in the world is Japan. I've been there twice and I'm waiting to go there again, with my lovely boyfriend (he's addicted to Japan too). I'm also studying japanese on a app since 1180 days.</p>

<p>My wish is being a developer, make this my job and change radically my career. I will work hard to make my wish come true.</p>
